# Flight-Fare-Prediction
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. 
It can be increased or decreased every now and then depending on various factors like the timing of the flights, destination, and duration of flights. 


### Problem Statement:
Optimal timing for airline ticket purchasing from the consumer’s perspective is challenging principally because buyers have insufficient information for reasoning about future price movements. 

### Goal:
we aim to build a model which predicts ticket prices for upcoming flights to help customers in selecting the optimum time for travel and the cheapest flight to the desired destination

### Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.
