# Flight-Fare-Prediction
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. 
It can be increased or decreased every now and then depending on various factors like the timing of the flights, destination, and duration of flights. 


### Problem Statement:
Optimal timing for airline ticket purchasing from the consumer’s perspective is challenging principally because buyers have insufficient information for reasoning about future price movements. 

### Goal:
we aim to build a model which predicts ticket prices for upcoming flights to help customers in selecting the optimum time for travel and the cheapest flight to the desired destination

### Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

### Conclusion:
So, we have used the ML model for this data,
As a result, we were able to successfully train our model to forecast pricing flights and complete the required work.

### Future work:
This may be expanded in the future to also include airline ticket payment details, which can offer more detail about each area, such as the timestamp of entry and exit, seat placement, covered auxiliary items, and so on.

We will also examine specific technological Models, such as Deeper Learning methods, meanwhile striving to enhance existing models by modifying their hyper-parameters to get the optimum design for airline price prediction.
